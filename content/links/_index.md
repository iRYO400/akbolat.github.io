### A little story of my beginning
    My first attempt as a technical writer started in 2016 at www.iryos-workshop.com, which no longer belongs to me. 
I did it for only one purpose to get my first job. At some point of view, it worked, but I stopped posting new content for two years.
Later, I continued posting while I was finishing my bachelor's degree(actually, I was unemployed too).
Then again, that cycle is repeating and I'm here.

List of my old articles from archived website:
